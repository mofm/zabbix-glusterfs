This project was created to monitor Gluster Storage with Zabbix.
In this repository there are two files.
One python script that calls [gstatus](https://github.com/gluster/gstatus), discovering gluster volumes and print data we want, according to the arguments given.
You have to install gstatus [gstatus](https://github.com/gluster/gstatus)

You should save the script in /usr/local/bin/ and do it executable. Use visudo and give privileges to zabbix user.
```
visudo
```
Paste the following line!
```
zabbix ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: gstatus_discovery.py
```
You have to add glusterfs.conf file in /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent.conf.d/

* You should save the script in /usr/local/bin directory and do it executable from zabbix user using sudo.
* The last one shoud be import zabbix_template.xml in zabbix
